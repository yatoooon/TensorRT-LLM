## TensorRT-LLM Overview

TensorRT-LLM is an easy-to-use Python API to define Large
Language Models (LLMs) and build
[TensorRT](https://developer.nvidia.com/tensorrt) engines that contain
state-of-the-art optimizations to perform inference efficiently on NVIDIA GPUs.
TensorRT-LLM contains components to create Python and C++ runtimes that
execute those TensorRT engines. It also includes a
[backend](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend)
for integration with the
[NVIDIA Triton Inference Server](https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-triton-inference-server);
a production-quality system to serve LLMs.  Models built with TensorRT-LLM can
be executed on a wide range of configurations going from a single GPU to
multiple nodes with multiple GPUs (using
[Tensor Parallelism](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/nemo_megatron/parallelisms.html#tensor-parallelism)
and/or
[Pipeline Parallelism](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/nemo/user-guide/docs/en/stable/nlp/nemo_megatron/parallelisms.html#pipeline-parallelism)).

The TensorRT-LLM Python API architecture looks similar to the
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org) API. It provides a
[functional](./tensorrt_llm/functional.py) module containing functions like
`einsum`, `softmax`, `matmul` or `view`. The [layers](./tensorrt_llm/layers)
module bundles useful building blocks to assemble LLMs; like an `Attention`
block, a `MLP` or the entire `Transformer` layer. Model-specific components,
like `GPTAttention` or `BertAttention`, can be found in the
[models](./tensorrt_llm/models) module.

TensorRT-LLM comes with several popular models pre-defined. They can easily be
modified and extended to fit custom needs. Refer to the [Support Matrix](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/reference/support-matrix.html) for a list of supported models.

To maximize performance and reduce memory footprint, TensorRT-LLM allows the
models to be executed using different quantization modes (refer to
[`support matrix`](https://nvidia.github.io/TensorRT-LLM/reference/support-matrix.html#software)).  TensorRT-LLM supports
INT4 or INT8 weights (and FP16 activations; a.k.a.  INT4/INT8 weight-only) as
well as a complete implementation of the
[SmoothQuant](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.10438) technique.
