## TensorRT-LLM Release 0.10.0

### Announcements
- TensorRT-LLM supports TensorRT 10.0.1 and NVIDIA NGC 24.03 containers.

### Key Features and Enhancements
- The Python high level API
  - Added embedding parallel, embedding sharing, and fused MLP support.
  - Enabled the usage of the `executor` API.
- Added a weight-stripping feature with a new `trtllm-refit` command. For more information, refer to `examples/sample_weight_stripping/README.md`.
- Added a weight-streaming feature. For more information, refer to `docs/source/advanced/weight-streaming.md`.
- Enhanced the multiple profiles feature; `--multiple_profiles` argument in `trtllm-build` command builds more optimization profiles now for better performance.
- Added FP8 quantization support for Mixtral.
- Added support for pipeline parallelism for GPT.
- Optimized `applyBiasRopeUpdateKVCache` kernel by avoiding re-computation.
- Reduced overheads between `enqueue` calls of TensorRT engines.
- Added support for paged KV cache for enc-dec models. The support is limited to beam width 1.
- Added W4A(fp)8 CUTLASS kernels for the NVIDIA Ada Lovelace architecture.
- Added debug options (`--visualize_network` and `--dry_run`) to the `trtllm-build` command to visualize the TensorRT network before engine build.
- Integrated the new NVIDIA Hopper XQA kernels for LLaMA 2 70B model.
- Improved the performance of pipeline parallelism when enabling in-flight batching.
- Supported quantization for Nemotron models.
- Added LoRA support for Mixtral and Qwen.
- Added in-flight batching support for ChatGLM models.
- Added support to `ModelRunnerCpp` so that it runs with the `executor` API for IFB-compatible models.
- Enhanced the custom `AllReduce` by adding a heuristic; fall back to use native NCCL kernel when hardware requirements are not satisfied to get the best performance.
- Optimized the performance of checkpoint conversion process for LLaMA.
- Benchmark
  - [BREAKING CHANGE] Moved the request rate generation arguments and logic from prepare dataset script to `gptManagerBenchmark`.
  - Enabled streaming and support `Time To the First Token (TTFT)` latency and `Inter-Token Latency (ITL)` metrics for `gptManagerBenchmark`.
  - Added the `--max_attention_window` option to `gptManagerBenchmark`.

### API Changes
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Set the default `tokens_per_block` argument of the `trtllm-build` command to 64 for better performance.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Migrated enc-dec models to the unified workflow.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Renamed `GptModelConfig` to `ModelConfig`.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Added speculative decoding mode to the builder API.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Refactor scheduling configurations
  - Unified the `SchedulerPolicy` with the same name in `batch_scheduler` and `executor`, and renamed it to `CapacitySchedulerPolicy`.
  - Expanded the existing configuration scheduling strategy from `SchedulerPolicy` to `SchedulerConfig` to enhance extensibility. The latter also introduces a chunk-based configuration called `ContextChunkingPolicy`.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] The input prompt was removed from the generation output in the `generate()` and `generate_async()` APIs. For example, when given a prompt as `A B`, the original generation result could be `<s>A B C D E` where only `C D E` is the actual output, and now the result is `C D E`.
- [BREAKING CHANGE] Switched default `add_special_token` in the TensorRT-LLM backend to `True`.
- Deprecated `GptSession` and `TrtGptModelV1`.

- Mixtral-8x7B model
- Support weight loading for HuggingFace Mixtral model
- OpenAI Whisper
- Mixture of Experts support

- Fixed LLaMa with LoRA error
- Fixed LLaMA GPTQ failure

- Fixed CodeLlama SQ accuracy issue

### Known Issues

- For LLaMA family models with biases, converting HF checkpoints with `*.safetensors` files under FP16/BF16 will run into error, as the biases are ignored. The suggestion to workaround these is to enable the legacy loading function by setting [the condition](../../tensorrt_llm/models/llama/convert.py?ref_type=heads#L1318-1319) to True, and this should be fixed in the next version.
- The hang reported in issue [#149](https://github.com/triton-inference-server/tensorrtllm_backend/issues/149) has not been reproduced by the TensorRT-LLM team. If it is caused by a bug in TensorRT-LLM, that bug may be present in that release.
